<h1 class="info-title">Exposome Data Platform</h1>

<p>
    View the inventory of data used by epidemiological studies in the Exposome-NL and EXPANSE projects. For background information on our conceptualization of the exposome and the categorization into four dimensions, consult these openly accessible publications: 
</p>
<ul class="info-list">
    <li><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay3164" target="_blank">The exposome and health: Where chemistry meets biology</a></li>

<h2 class="info-section-title">Data Request Process</h2>

<p>
    To request access to any data layer, complete the
    <a href="https://surfdrive.surf.nl/s/PhbCHIuqvjASVFe?dir=/&editing=false&openfile=true" target="_blank">
        Data Access Request Form
    </a>
    and send it to <u>exposome.office@uu.nl</u>.
</p>

<p>Information required includes:</p>

<ul class="info-list">
    <li>Type of client (non-commercial, commercial)</li>
    <li>Applicant contact details</li>
    <li>Suggested output channel</li>
    <li>Working title of the project</li>
    <li>Brief description of objectives, outcomes, and statistical plan</li>
    <li>Selected environmental variables ("Surfaces")</li>
    <li>Cohort data to be used (if any)</li>
    <li>Procedures</li>
    <li>Funding source(s)</li>
    <li>Preliminary proposal for analyses and publication</li>
    <li>Foreseen timeline</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Proposals are forwarded to the Exposome-NL steering group. If there is no objection within three weeks, the proposal is considered to be approved. If there are questions then the request may need to be further considered - which may require revisions to the proposed plan. If a disagreement within the steering group exists with regard to approval or not, the steering group will gather and discuss the proposal. If no consensus can be reached, the steering group will vote. The majority of votes will determine the decision, and this decision will then be final.
</p>

<p>
    All data access and publication proposals will be assessed against the following criteria: 1. Scientific rigour of analyses, 2. appropriate project group, and 3. overlap with other known analysis using the platform.
</p>


<h3 class="info-subsection-title">General Rules</h3>

<ul class="info-list">
    <li>The geographic data that are provided after acceptance may only be used for the analyses as specified in the accepted publication proposal, and may not be further used or distributed.</li>
    <li>New research questions require the submission of a new proposal.</li>
    <li>Accepted publication proposals will be shared with the wider Exposome-NL consortium.</li>
    <li>Use of geographic data is free of charge for non-commercial requests including a maximum of 1,000 geographical locations. For more than 1,000 geographical locations a fee of 2,000€ will be charged. For commercial parties that want to make use of the Exposome-NL data platform a financial compensation is required as well.</li>
    <li>Projects that require tailored work by Utrecht University (e.g. data managers, GIS experts) will be asked for a non-profit compensation fee based on the project plan.</li>
    <li>Cohort owners are responsible to initiate appropriate agreements needed in line with the chosen procedure of using the surface data (e.g. processing agreement).</li>
    <li>Upon publication: a (link to the) pdf of the paper needs to be provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="info-section-title">Using the data</h2>
<p>
    To learn how to work with the Exposome Data platform, refer to the
    <a href="https://surfdrive.surf.nl/s/b33zjSBPmrdRnPp?dir=/&editing=false&openfile=true" target="_blank">
        Instruction Manual

</p>

<h2 class="info-section-title">Publication Policy</h2>

<p>All manuscripts and (poster) presentations utilising the data platform should include the following acknowledgement:</p>

<blockquote class="info-quote">
    “Exposome surfaces were made available through the following projects: EXPANSE (ECH 2020, grant agreement No 874627) and EXPOSOME-NL. EXPOSOME-NL is funded through the Gravitation program of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO grant number 024.004.017).”
</blockquote>

<p>
    Manuscripts must cite both the source data and the tool. Include in the manuscript the reference belonging to the used surfaces. These can be found in the metadata of each surface.
    For example, if you use (O<sub>3</sub> concentrations) for your analyses, in your manuscript you will refer to its source paper:
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018309759" target="_blank">
        https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018309759
    </a>
    .
</p>

<p>
    Also include the sentence:  
    <blockquote class="info-quote">
    “Surface data was linked through the Exposome Data Platform tool (https://exposome.uu.nl).”
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    If possible, posters, brochures, infographics and PowerPoint slides in which data from the data platform is featured should contain the Exposome-NL logo. Please contact Exposome-NL <u>exposome.office@uu.nl</u> for a high-resolution version.
